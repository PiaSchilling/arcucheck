== Introduction and Goals

[role="arc42help"]
****
Arcucheck is a tool for static architecture conformance checking based on PlantUML diagramms.

.Core mission of the system
The system warns if the implementation deviates from the planned architecture.
The most important aspects of the specialist domain are architecture, warning and relationships.

.Category of the systems
Development process support system ->
The system is intended to optimize the process of software development and architecture and make it more pleasant.
****

=== Requirements Overview

[role="arc42help"]
****
.Functional requirements
* the system outputs textual warnings about deviations form the planned architecture
* the system is able to process existing PlantUML class diagramms
* the system is able to autogenerate PlantUML class diagramms form existing Java codebases
* the system is able to compare those two PlantUML class diagramms
* the system categorises the detected deviations and outputs the corresponding warning
* the system provides a CLI, so it can be included in CI/CD processes

.Note
 The system should not be a finished product with a variety of features at the end of the development period, but rather serve as a prototype so that it can be evaluated whether this approach is useful for checking static architectural conformity

[cols="1,1,1"]
|===
|Quality goal |General description| System specific description

|Operability (ease of use)
|Degree to which the software product makes it easy for users to operate and control it
|The system should be as easy as possible for developers to use without much additional effort (automated at best)

|Functional suitability (accuracy)
|Does the system deliver results with the required degree of precision?
|Warnings should be appropriately accurate and categorized

|Compatibility (interoperability)
|Ability to interact with predefined systems. This also includes embedding in the operating infrastructure.
|The system should be embeddable in the CI/CD infrastructure.

|Role|Description|Expectations

| potential user: software architect
| The person(s) responsible for the design of the system
| Compliance with the designed architecture is checked by using the system and improved if necessary. Monitoring of the compliance status without much additional effort.

| potential user: software developer
| The person(s) responsible for implementing the system
| Raising awareness of the decay of architecture. Better cooperation with architects. Improved development experience in the long term.

| potential user: DevOps engineer
| The person(s) responsible for the CI/CD processes
| Simple integration of the system in pipelines.

| Pia Schilling
| Developer of arucheck
|Development of a prototype system suitable for evaluation in the Bachelor's thesis. Detailed documentation to make the work process comprehensible.

| Examiners
| First and second examiner of the Bachelor's thesis
| System that is described and evaluated in detail and the design decisions are justified. Development process should be comprehensible. Presumably no expectation of a fully functional system.
